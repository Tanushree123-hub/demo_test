# Multilingual Clinical Notes Ingestion Project

![image](assets/introimage.jpg)

# Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of global health care, effective communication and data management are paramount. With the rise of diverse patient populations and multilingual documentation, the need for a system that can seamlessly integrate and interpret clinical notes from various languages has never been more pressing. The Multilingual Clinical Notes Analysis Project represents a groundbreaking solution designed to address this challenge head on.

By integrating Health Level 7 (HL7) standards, the project ensures a smooth transition from traditional record-keeping to a more sophisticated, AI-powered data management system. The goal is to improve the efficiency of healthcare providers, enhance patient care, and unlock new insights from clinical data that were previously inaccessible due to language barriers. The Multilingual Clinical Notes Analysis Project is more than a technological innovation; it is a commitment to inclusivity and excellence in healthcare.

# Workflow Overview

Ingestion: HL7 messages containing clinical notes are collected and stored.
Blob Storage: Initial raw data is kept in blob storage for durability and accessibility.

Data Processing: Azure Data Factory orchestrates the transformation of data, which is then ingested into a Data Lakehouse.

NLP Enrichment: Language detection and normalization occur before GPT-4 generates summaries and embeddings of the clinical notes.

Delta Storage: The enriched data is stored in Delta tables to ensure that it is versioned and queryable.

Database Integration: The processed data is made available through Azure Cosmos DB, which is compatible with MongoDB, for easy application integration.

# The sentence translates to English as:

"The patient presents a three-day history of nonspecific abdominal pain, moderate in intensity, localized in the lower abdomen. There are no associated symptoms of fever, vomiting, or diarrhea. Significant past medical history for similar episodes in the last year, evaluated without a specific diagnosis. Physical examination reveals slight tenderness in the lower abdominal quadrants, with no rebound or guarding. Plan: An abdominal ultrasound is recommended to rule out gallstones. Further evaluation with gastroenterology may be necessary based on the ultrasound results."

# Prompt:

I have a clinical note that I need translated into English. The note contains important medical information about a patient's condition, symptoms, medical history, physical examination findings, and the recommended plan of action. It is written in a language other than English and contains specific medical terminology that is crucial to the patient's care. The translation must accurately convey the original meaning and medical terms to ensure the information is communicated effectively. Please translate the following clinical note into English

# Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure we have:

An Azure account with active subscriptions.
Access to Azure Blob Storage, Data Factory, Lakehouse, and Cosmos DB services.
GPT-4 API access credentials.
Git installed on your local machine.
Python installed on your local machine (version 3.8 or higher recommended).

# Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

git clone [URL to the repository]
cd [repository name]

Replace [URL to the repository] with the actual URL and [repository name] with the name of the repository you cloned.

# Step 2: Install Dependencies
Navigate to the repository directory and install the required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root of the project directory and populate it with your service keys and endpoints:

AZURE_STORAGE_KEY="your_azure_storage_key"
AZURE_DATA_FACTORY_NAME="your_data_factory_name"
COSMOS_DB_CONNECTION_STRING="your_cosmos_db_connection_string"
GPT4_API_KEY="your_gpt4_api_key"

# Step 4: Deploy Azure Resources

Use Azure CLI to deploy the necessary Azure resources.

# Step 5: Run Data Processing Pipelines

Navigate to the Azure Data Factory interface and trigger the data processing pipelines. Alternatively, you can use the provided script to automate this:

python run_pipeline.py

# Step 6: Verify Data Ingestion and Processing

Check the Azure Lakehouse and Delta tables to ensure that data is being processed and stored correctly.

# Step 7: Accessing the Processed Data

Use the provided scripts or queries within Azure Cosmos DB to access and interact with the processed data:

python query_data.py --query "SELECT * FROM ClinicalNotes WHERE PatientID = '12345'"
